        military I did 4yrs in the infantry before re-classifying a computer analyst which would lead into the career I
        would have as a civilian. The following are a list of some of the job functions I performed:</p>

      <table>
        <ul>
          <li>Responsible for 10 soldiers under my command which included guiding, counseling, and mentoring soldier
            development.</li>
          <li>Charged with maintaining $15B IT infrastructure which included insuring high availability and failover for
            mission critical systems responsible for providing combat units with real-time battlefield intelligence.
          </li>
          <li>Worked with various internal groups and multiple vendors to ensure the timely and accurate installation of
            all aspects of IT/network services.</li>
          <li>Delivery of end-to-end solutions for network connectivity including facilitation of the installation of
            new network nodes (multifunctional/multi-user information processing systems, peripheral equipment, and
            associated devices in mobile and fixed facilities)</li>
          <li>The delivery of new WAN network services</li>

      <p>I had the opportunity given by Xebia/McKinsey to engage in a Consulting assignment for devising a future
        roadmap for one of their products â€“ Digital Evaluations. The objective of the discovery was to: Identify and
        recommend a high-level end-state architecture for the Digital Evaluations product that focuses on long-term
        maintainability, scalability, and reuse within the McKinsey ecosystem. Provide a development strategy and
        delivery/release plan that iteratively moves from current state to the desired end state architecture includes a
        strategy for remediation of existing architecture and balances the realities of our current state with
        architectural and business vision.</p>
